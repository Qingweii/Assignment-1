# Assignment-1
This website will be about my own personal website to give site's users an overall understanding of my progress, achievements in my school years. It will be most suitable for recruiters since it is a portfolio about myself and my personal journey.

# Design rationale
The overall design of this website will be simple and straighforward yet with aesthetic theme to it (mostly warm colours) as I felt that the colours describe me as a person of being approachable and I want to portray that feel to the users when they are at my website.
There will also be some interactions for users to click on.


# Features 
- Users will be brought to that specific page when they click on the navigation bar titles

- There will also be some buttons that will bring users to another page such as a button that links to my current resume to learn more about me

- There are also interactive buttons (eg. carousel, qualification tab) for users to click on that will show the hidden images/information

- Through the ContactMe page, they can also send me their message if they are interested to hire me and there will be confirmation message(words) on the Submit button to show that they have successfully send it to me

- If they try to submit an empty form, there will appear an error message about the required fields 

- The footer page also contains some of my social media platforms (instagram, facebook, linkedin) where they can find me through those applications/apps 

- Some of the tabs at the footer also links them to some of my current website pages as well and there is also a arrow button for them to return back to my Home page

- My website works on different screen sizes (media queries) as well (eg, mobile, tablets...)

# Testing
- One of the interesting bug i found is at the ContactMe page:
 - When the users were to click on the submit button without typing any text on the textbox, the button text will still change to 'thanks' but the error message also appears at the required field
